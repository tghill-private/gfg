# Use this file to generate multiple gifs of cross sections of the data created by a model run. For each gif you want created, set the following variables:
# cut_var: the coordinate to produce the cross section at. Must be 'x', 'y', or 'z'
# cut_val: the value at which to produce the cross section at
# name_var: the prefix of the .data and .meta files. Example 'T' or 'rho'
# movie_name: the desired name of the generated movie
#
# Optional parameters:
# vmin and vmax: Desired minimum and maximum for the colour map scale. If not given, scale will likely be inconsistent. Not required for temperature
# file_type: The file type to save the images in. By default, saves as a png. Options are 'emf', 'eps', 'pdf', 'png', 'ps', 'raw', 'rgba', 'svg', and 'svgz'
# stitch_gif: Boolean controlling whether or not to stitch the images into a gif. By defualt True
# iter_start, iter_end: the range of iterations to plot, inclusive. By default, the entire runtime is plotted
# x_axis_start, x_axis_end: the range of the x-axis coordinate to plot, in meters and inclusive. By default, entire range is plotted
# y_axis_start, y_axis_end: the range of the y-axis coordinate to plot, in meters and inclusive. By default, entire range is plotted
# image_folder_name: name of the folder to save images in. By defualt, "PNG_IMAGES"
# gif_folder_name: name of the folder to save gifs in. By default, "GIF_MOVIES"
#
# End each set of variables with a '&' (no quotes) on its own lines
