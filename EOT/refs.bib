abstract = {Accurate simulations of freshwater lake ice are integral for the study of climatic variability in northern environments. Surface albedo, a component often parameterized in lake ice models, has been shown to affect the timing of ice break-up during the melt season. In situ snow and ice albedo measurements were taken over a partially snow-covered freshwater lake near Churchill, Manitoba for the evaluation of the albedo parameterization of the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) albedo products (MOD10A1/MYD10A1 and MCD43A3). The albedo simulations using CLIMo were performed with and without snow integrated into the model and evaluated against in situ albedo measurements recorded over clear ice, snow ice and snow-covered ice. The simulated snow albedo from CLIMo for the entire ice growth season evaluated against snow albedo observations had a root mean square error of 0.07, a mean absolute error of 0.06, and a mean bias error (MBE) of -0.01. With snow removed from CLIMo, the albedo parameterization overestimated albedo values measured in the field over snow-free clear ice and snow ice with MBE values of 0.13 and 0.10, respectively. These findings suggest that CLIMo's bare ice albedo parameterization needs to be revised to account for albedo differences between ice types. The evaluation of the MODIS albedo products with in situ snow and ice albedo observations and the comparison of these satellite products with CLIMo's albedo parameterization during the melt period, when in situ radiation measurement stations needed to be removed from the lake-ice surface, are addressed in paper Part II. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd.},

The model can be driven with observed daily or hourly atmospheric forcing of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, cloud amount and snowfall. In addition to computing the energy balance components, key model output includes the temperature profile at an arbitrary number of levels within the ice/snow (or the water temperature if there is no ice) and ice thickness (clear ice and snow-ice) on a daily basis, as well as freeze-up and break-up dates.

@article{PaulsonSimpson1977,
abstract = {Abstract Observations were made of downward solar radiation as a function of depth during an experiment in the North Pacific (35°N, 155°W). The irradiance meter employed was sensitive to solar radiation of wavelength 400–1000 nm arriving from above at a horizontal surface. Because of selective absorption of the short and long wavelengths, the irradiance decreases much faster than exponential in the upper few meters, falling to one-third of the incident value between 2 and 3 m depth. Below 10 m the decrease was exponential at a rate characteristic of moderately clear water of Type IA. Neglecting one case having low sun altitude, the observations are well represented by the expression I/I0=Rez/$\zeta$1+(1−R)ez$\zeta$2, where I is the irradiance at depth −z, I0 is the irradiance at the surface less reflected solar radiation, R=0.62, $\zeta$1 and $\zeta$2 are attenuation lengths equal to 1.5 and 20 m, respectively, and z is the vertical space coordinate, positive upward with the origin at mean sea level.

Semtner's three-layer framework is used, but the brine content of the upper ice is represented with a variable heat capacity as is done in more physically based models.

@article{JackettMcDougall1995,
abstract = {Abstract Hydrographic data, be it raw or highly averaged observational data, contain substantial regions having vertical density inversions. An algorithm is described that minimally modifies such data so that the resulting hydrographic casts have vertical buoyancy frequency profiles larger than a specified lower bound. The method underlying the algorithm is based on the solution of a constrained weighted least-squares problem and maximizes the smoothness of the resulting salinity-potential temperature diagram. Examples are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique in minimally altering hydrographic data only in the immediate vicinity of the data that do not already satisfy the buoyancy frequency constraint. A modified equation of state, identical in form to the international equation of state of seawater but written in terms of potential rather than in situ temperature, is also provided, enabling rapid computation of the thermal expansion and saline contraction coefficients.},
